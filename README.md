- [`services-flake`](https://github.com/juspay/services-flake): NixOS-like services built on top of process-compose-flake.
- [`proc-flake`](https://github.com/srid/proc-flake): A similar module that uses a `Procfile`-based runner. It is less feature-rich, but [at times more reliable](https://github.com/Platonic-Systems/process-compose-flake/issues/30) than process-compose.
