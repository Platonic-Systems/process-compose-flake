# Process management using `process-compose-flake`

[process-compose-flake](https://github.com/Platonic-Systems/process-compose-flake) is a [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/) module for [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose).

This `flake-parts` module allows you to declare one or more `process-compose` configurations using Nix attribute sets. It will generate corresponding `packages` that wrap the `process-compose` binary with the given configuration.

This module is practical for local development e.g. if you have a lot of runtime dependencies that depend on each other. Stop executing these programs imperatively over and over again in a specific order, and stop the need to write complicated shell scripts to automate this. `process-compose` gives you a process dashboard for monitoring, inspecting logs for each process, and much more, all of this in a TUI.

## Quick Example

See [`example/flake.nix`](https://github.com/Platonic-Systems/process-compose-flake/blob/main/example/flake.nix) for an example flake. This example shows a demo of [sqlite-web](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlite-web) using the sample [chinhook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).

To run this example locally,

```bash
mkdir example && cd example
nix flake init -t github:Platonic-Systems/process-compose-flake
nix run
```

This should open http://127.0.0.1:8213/ in your web browser. If not, navigate to the logs for the `sqlite-web` process and access the URL. Use `demo` as the password to access sqlite-web. The interface should look like this:

## Usage
Let's say you want to have a `devShell` that makes a command `watch-server` available, that you can use to spin up your projects `backend-server`, `frontend-server`, and `proxy-server`.

To achieve this using `process-compose-flake` you can simply add the following code to the `perSystem` function in your `flake-parts` flake.
```nix
process-compose.watch-server = {
  settings.processes = {
    backend-server.command = "${self'.apps.backend-server.program} --port 9000";
    frontend-server.command = "${self'.apps.frontend-server.program} --port 9001";
    proxy-server.command =
      let
        proxyConfig = pkgs.writeTextFile {
          name = "proxy.conf";
          text = ''
            ...
          '';
        };
      in
      "${self'.apps.proxy-server.program} -c ${proxyConfig} -p 8000";
  };
};
```

`process-compose-flake` will generate the `packages.${system}.watch-server` output for you.

You can then spin up the processes by running `nix run .#watch-server`.

The `package` output in turn can be used to make the `watch-server` command available in your `devShell`:

```nix
devShells = {
  default = pkgs.mkShell {
    name = "my-shell";
    nativeBuildInputs = [
      self'.packages.watch-server
    ];
  };
};
```

You can enter your devShell by running `nix develop` and run `watch-server` to run your processes.

### preHook

If you'd like to run certain commands before starting the processes, you can add them to `preHook`:

```nix
process-compose.watch-server = {
  preHook = ''
    # Cleanup on EXIT, this runs irrespective of exit-code of process-compose
    trap "rm -rf ./data" EXIT
    export USER=foo
  '';
};
```

### postHook

Or if you'd like to run certain commands upon successful execution of `process-compose`, i.e exits with `exit-code: 0`, then add them to `postHook`:

```nix
process-compose.watch-server = {
  postHook = ''
    cat foo.txt
  '';
};
```

## Module API

Our submodule mirrors the [process-compose YAML schema](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose/blob/main/process-compose.yaml). A few things to remember:

- `process-compose.<name>.environment`: In the YAML config, a list of environment strings are specified. While this is supported, you can also specify the env vars as a Nix attrset
- `process-compose.<name>.processes.<name>.command`: The command string does not have access to the process environment, so if your command becomes shellscript-like you probably want to wrap it in a `pkgs.writeShellApplication` (see [\#22](https://github.com/Platonic-Systems/process-compose-flake/issues/22)).
- `process-compose.<name>.shell`: This is set to `pkgs.bash` by default, obviating reproducibility issues due to depending on globally available bash.

- [`proc-flake`](https://github.com/srid/proc-flake): A similar module that uses a `Procfile`-based runner. It is less feature-rich, but [at times more reliable](https://github.com/Platonic-Systems/process-compose-flake/issues/30) than process-compose.
